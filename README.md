# Toggle-Console-on-Top-WindowsOnly-Blender addon
toggle the window console and be sure it's opening on top!  
in the Window Menu > Toggle Console On Top  
there you can add a shortcut ALT+F1 should be ok

# Always_on_top
you can add this script (alwaysOnTop.ahk) in your menu start (command shell:startup)  

PRESS ALT+F12 to pin unpin, always on top, the Windows console (the blender one or not!) (marked then ¤¤¤¤¤ PINNED ¤¤¤¤¤)  
the console must just be opened (not needeed to be active(to click on it))
N.B: if there are several Windows consoles, it will be on the last active

PRESS CRTL+ALT+F12 to pin unpin, always on top, ANY ACTIVE WINDOW! (marked then ¤¤¤¤¤ PINNED ¤¤¤¤¤)  
(to unpin no need to make the window active again)

so in blender typically you press Alt+F1(don't forget to create it) to open the console on top
and then you can press Alt+F12 to make it PINNED always on top even if it is behind again and not selected
